= Introduction

The gprof-exit package supplies an object file that redefines +_exit+ to print
profiling information for the
http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/[gprof] program.  This allows use of gprof
to profile programs that call +_exit+ directly rather than calling +exit+.

== Installation

== How to use gprof-exit
To use gprof-exit with a typical +/package+ project, alter the the
+conf-cc+ and +conf-ld+ files in the package you wish to profile to include any
desired gprof options.  In +conf-ld+ also include the full path to your version
of +gprof_exit.o+ as an object-file argument.
